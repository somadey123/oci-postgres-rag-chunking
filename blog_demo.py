"""Compare overlapping chunks for one complete PostgreSQL troubleshooting workflow.

Two measures per strategy:
  evidence coverage  - did each required passage reach the model complete?
  answer correctness - did the answer keep each required element of the procedure,
                       and is everything it says backed by the passages it was given?
Answers are generated several times per strategy (--runs) so one lucky or unlucky answer
cannot decide the comparison.
